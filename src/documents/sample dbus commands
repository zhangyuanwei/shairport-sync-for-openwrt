# For the "Native" Shairport Sync D-Bus Interface support, Shairport Sync must be built with the D-Bus interface support. Add the '--with-dbus-interface' flag at the ./configure stage.

# There is a simple test client that you can build -- add the '--with-dbus-test-client' flag at the ./configure stage. You'll get an executable called shairport-sync-dbus-test-client
# After attempting to send some commands, it will listen for property changes on the D-Bus interface and report them on the console.

# Additionally, the following are examples of using the CLI command "dbus-send" to send D-Bus commands to Shairport Sync:

# Get Log Verbosity
