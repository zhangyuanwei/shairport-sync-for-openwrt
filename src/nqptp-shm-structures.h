#define NQPTP_SHM_STRUCTURES_VERSION 9
#define NQPTP_CONTROL_PORT 9000

// The control port expects a UDP packet with the first character being a command letter
// and the rest being any arguments, the whole not to exceed 4096 characters.
// The "T" command,  must followed by nothing or by
// a space and a space-delimited list of IPv4 or IPv6 numbers.
// The IPs, if provided, will become the new list of timing peers, replacing any
// previous list. The first IP number is the clock that NQPTP will listen to.
// The remaining IP address are the addresses of all the timing peers. The timing peers
// are not used in this version of NQPTP.
// If no timing list is provided, the existing timing list is deleted.
// The "B" command is a message that the client -- which generates the clock --
// is about to start playing.
// NQPTP uses it to determine that the clock is active and will not sleep.
// The "E" command signifies that the client has stopped playing and that
// the clock may shortly sleep.
// The "P" command signifies that SPS has paused play (buffered audio only).
// The clock seems to stay running in this state.

// When the clock is active, it is assumed that any decreases in the offset
// between the local and remote clocks are due to delays in the network.
// NQPTP smooths the offset by clamping any decreases to a small value.
// In this way, it can follow clock drift but ignore network delays.

// When the clock is inactive, it can stop running. This causes the offset to decrease.
// NQPTP clock smoothing would treat this as a network delay, causing true sync to be lost.
// To avoid this, when the clock goes from inactive to active,
// NQPTP resets clock smoothing to the new offset.
